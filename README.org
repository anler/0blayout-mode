* 0bL(ayout)-mode

The plan with this mode is to create a different workflow when handling layouts,
the intended workflow is planned to be based on 3 basic functions.

 1) Create new layout (C-c C-l C-c)
 2) Switch between layouts (C-c C-l C-b)
 3) Kill layouts (C-c C-l C-k)

** Create new layout
Before doing anything, you should create a new layout, this will be the layout
that you'll be working in. When you have done this, you'll enabled the rest of
the mode.

** Switch between layouts
Only works if you stand in a layout. This feature will save the current layout
and then switch to the decided one.

** Kill layouts
Kill the current layout, jump to next layout in list, if no next layout exist,
set current-layout to nil and jump to a fullscreen *scratch* buffer.
